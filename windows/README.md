## Windows 10 with WSL

Install WSL for linux support. This is useful, if you want to re-use your
Linux dotfiles in Windows.

### Gotchas'
There is still some problems with Linux environment
on Windows. The main problem I faced was, Command-Line gets pretty slow, if you customize
the terminal with too many aliases and theming.

## Windows 10 with ConEMU (I used Cmder)

Cmdr provides a fast emulater for Win cmd/powershell.
You can theme it and use pretty basic linux like shortcuts too.

`./alias.cmd` contains my aliases that used directly for Cmder.

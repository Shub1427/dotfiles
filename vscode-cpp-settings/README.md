#CPP Settings and Extensions for VSCode

By Default VSCode supports basic programming of C++, using G++ with
c11/c++17 standards.

Learn about the Microsoft CPP extension [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp).

> NOTE: Have been fiddling with Sublime-Text-3 CPP Base setup for MAC
> [Check this Gist](https://gist.github.com/Shub1427/f8c866b7c66f3af05b00d4db9c676fcc),
> but VSCode is way better to setup and code CPP.
> Use the included `tasks.json` file for initial CPP setup.
